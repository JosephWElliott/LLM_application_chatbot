# LLM Application Chatbot Web Interface

Overview

This project is an AI-based chatbot web application that allows users to communicate with an AI model through a simple, intuitive web interface. It leverages Flask for backend functionality and integrates machine learning models from the Transformers library to handle user input and generate responses.

Key Features:
Chat Interface: A web-based chat interface with user-friendly input and response display.
Dynamic Responses: The chatbot responds dynamically to user queries and displays both user messages and AI responses with avatars.
Loading Indicator: Displays a loading animation while the AI processes the request.
Error Handling: Manages errors by displaying appropriate messages to the user when something goes wrong.

File Structure

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
index.html: The main front-end of the application that contains the structure of the chatbot interface, including a text area for user input, a send button, and a display area for responses.

Key components:
Text area for entering prompts.
Button for sending the prompt.
JavaScript for handling button click events and sending data to the server.

style.css: Contains the styling for the chatbot UI, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive. Key features include:
Background images and general layout adjustments.

Styling for chat messages and avatars to differentiate between user and bot responses.
script.js: Manages the chat interaction, including sending the user’s message to the Flask backend, handling the chatbot's response, and controlling the loading animations.

script.js: Handles the POST requests to the Flask server when a message is sent from the front-end and manages displaying the chatbot’s response.

Backend
app.py: The Flask application that processes incoming user messages, interacts with the AI model, and sends back responses.

Routes:
/chatbot: Handles POST requests for user messages, processes them with the AI model, and returns the chatbot’s response.
Dockerfile: A Docker configuration file to containerize the web application for easier deployment. It specifies the environment and dependencies necessary to run the application.

requirements.txt: Lists the required Python libraries for the application, including:

Flask: Web framework for building the application.
Flask_Cors: Handles cross-origin resource sharing.
torch, torchvision, torchaudio: Libraries for using the PyTorch framework for machine learning tasks.
transformers: Provides access to pre-trained Transformer-based models for natural language processing.

Static Assets
favicon.ico: The favicon for the web application.
Bot_logo.png: The bot’s avatar image for chat responses.
Error.png: An image displayed when an error occurs.
user.jpeg: The user’s avatar image for chat messages.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
Flask
Docker (optional, for containerization)
Access to a GPU is recommended for faster AI model performance.
Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/chatbot-app.git
cd chatbot-app

Install dependencies: Install the required Python libraries using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask server: Run the Flask server to start the chatbot application:
python app.py

Run with Docker: If you prefer to use Docker for deployment:
docker build -t chatbot-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 chatbot-app

Usage
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 after running the Flask app.

Enter your message into the chat window and click "Send."

The chatbot will process the message and respond accordingly. If there is an issue, an error message will be displayed.

Example
User Input: “Hello, how are you?”
Bot Response: “I’m just a chatbot, but I’m here to help! How can I assist you today?”

Future Improvements
Expand AI Capabilities: Integrate more advanced models for enhanced conversation handling.
UI Enhancements: Add features like custom themes, chat history, and multiple language support.
Model Customization: Train the chatbot on a specific dataset to make it more domain-specific.
